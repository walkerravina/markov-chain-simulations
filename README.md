======================

This repository contains various simulations of Markov Chains.
The aim of each simulation is to study the mixing time of each chain and see if the critical points
can be observed by using either coupling time or some other bound on the mixing time. The chains studied
include the Ising and Potts Models as well as the Hard Core gas model.
